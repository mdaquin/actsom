University of Cambridge,"The University of Cambridge is a public collegiate research university in Cambridge, England. Founded in 1209 and granted a royal charter by Henry III in 1231, Cambridge is the world's third oldest surviving university and one of its most prestigious, currently ranked second best in the world and the best in Europe by QS World University Rankings. Among the university's most notable alumni are 11 Fields Medalists, seven Turing Award winners, 47 heads of state, 14 British prime ministers, 194 Olympic medal-winning athletes, and some of world history's most transformational and iconic figures across disciplines, including Francis Bacon, Lord Byron, Oliver Cromwell, Charles Darwin, Stephen Hawking, John Maynard Keynes, John Milton, Vladimir Nabokov, Jawaharlal Nehru, Isaac Newton, Bertrand Russell, Manmohan Singh, Alan Turing, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and others. Cambridge alumni and faculty have won 121 Nobel Prizes, the most of any university in the world, according to the university. The University of Cambridge's 13th-century founding was largely inspired by an association of scholars then who fled the University of Oxford for Cambridge following the suspendium clericorium (hanging of the scholars) in a dispute with local townspeople. The two ancient English universities, though sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as Oxbridge. The university was founded from a variety of institutions, including 31 semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over 150 academic departments, faculties, and other institutions organised into six schools. All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, managing their own personnel and policies, and all students are required to have a college affiliation within the university. The university does not have a main campus, and its colleges and central facilities are scattered throughout the city. Undergraduate teaching at Cambridge centres on weekly group supervisions in the colleges in small groups of typically one to four students. This intensive method of teaching is widely considered the jewel in the crown of an Oxbridge undergraduate education. Lectures, seminars, laboratory work, and occasionally further supervisions are provided by the central university faculties and departments, and Postgraduate education is also predominantly provided centrally; degrees, however, are conferred by the university, not the colleges. By both endowment size and material consolidated assets, Cambridge is the wealthiest university in Europe and among the wealthiest in the world. In the 2019 fiscal year, the central university, excluding colleges, had total income of £2.192 billion, £592.4 million of which was from research grants and contracts. The central university and colleges together possessed a combined endowment of over £7.1 billion and overall consolidated net assets, excluding immaterial historical assets, of over £12.5 billion. Cambridge University Press & Assessment combines Cambridge University Press, the world's oldest university press, with one of the world's leading examining bodies; their publications reach in excess of eight million learners globally each year and some fifty million learners, teachers, and researchers monthly. The university operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum and Cambridge University Botanic Garden. Cambridge's 116 libraries hold a total of around 16 million books, around nine million of which are in Cambridge University Library, a legal deposit library and one of the world's largest academic libraries. Cambridge Union, the world's oldest debating society founded in 1815, inspired the emergence of university debating societies globally, including at Oxford. The university is closely linked to the high technology business cluster known as Silicon Fen, Europe's largest technology cluster. The university is also the central member of Cambridge University Health Partners, an academic health science centre based around the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, which is Europe's largest medical and science centre.",97.5

It was established in 2014 on the initiative of the then Chief Minister of Punjab Mian Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif. It was named after the famous Sufi poet Khwaja Ghulam Fareed. Khwaja Fareed Engineering & Information Technology University in Rahim Yar Khan is surely nothing lesser than a blessing for Southern Punjab, Northern Sindh and North Eastern Baluchistan. Established in 2014 under Punjab Assembly Act, the Khwaja Fareed University of Engineering & Information Technology (KFUEIT) Rahim Yar Khan, started its journey with merely 4 rooms, 5 faculty members and admission intake in 4 degree programs. KFUEIT embarked upon a tremendous growth track and started elevating the ladder every year. The vibrant leadership of the Vice Chancellor along with his very young and energetic team left no stone unturned in achieving targets of decades in just few months not only in terms of physical infrastructure but in academic excellence as well. Despite lots of stumbling blocks and bottlenecks, this roller coaster journey of exponential growth did not slow down owing to untiring commitment and dedication of the Vice Chancellor and his young team. Situated on Abu Dhabi Road Rahim Yar Khan, a beautiful and state of the art campus of KFUEIT is spread over 275 acres and is equipped with all modern facilities where more than 600 employees including 200 teaching faculty members are performing their duties in making this university a premium institution of the country in days to come. The fast-paced growth and such an increase in number of students is evident of the fact that this University is effectively serving to the needs to of the region and contributing towards the development of local economy. As per the safest estimates, KFUEIT has been able to reverse the flight of capital of around 2 billion per annum from local economy of this region, which was previously being spent in central and upper part of Pakistan. Particularly for girls, this university is an even bigger blessing, because many of the degree programs are of great interest of female students matching their educations aspirations and future endeavors. The year 2019 has also been scheduled to be yet another successful venture for KFUEIT. After the admissions of Fall 2019, KFUEIT will register its name in leading universities of country by growing to 16 departments, 94 degree programs, over 100 PhD qualified faculty members and crossing milestone of 10,000 students. Where KFUEIT is aggressively on its way to become a premium institution of this country in minimum possible time at one end, the severe financial crisis that is hitting this university in last one year and adversely affecting its growth on another end. With the shortage and non-releases of necessary funds from government for university, the achievement of aggressive targets seems difficult to achieve. Against all the odds, the leadership of university aims the wholesome development of students besides academic excellence and has never compromised on extracurricular activities in doing so. KFUEIT keeps arranging and hosting dozens of extracurricular activities including sports gala, seminars, exhibitions, declamation contests, Na’at and Qir’at contests, Pakistan Day, Defence Day, Kashmir Day, Eid Milad un Nabi, Dramatic Performance, Students societies and many other events within and outside the campus to develop and motivate the students.",
