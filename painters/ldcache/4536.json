two general pieces of negotiation advice. The first is to make promises, not threats. A threat would be \u201cif you can\u2019t match the salary, I\u2019m going to take that other job offer.\u201d A promise would be \u201cif you can match that salary, I will sign a new agreement today.\u201d Promises are framed positively rather than negatively, so they are easier for your negotiating partner to agree to. And they leave you strategic flexibility; if they can\u2019t match the salary you can still sign tomorrow.\n\n\nThe second is to be honest. One should not explicitly lie in negotiations . But one should also avoid deception, which may not be fraudulent but is nonetheless unethical.
