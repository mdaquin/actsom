play no role. property rights are an instrument of society and derive their significance from the fact that they help a man form those expectations which he can reasonably hold in his dealings with others. These expectations find expression in society's laws, customs, and more. An owner of property rights possesses the consent of fellowmen to allow him to act in particular ways. An owner expects the community to prevent others from interfering with his actions, provided that these actions are not prohibited in the specifications of his rights."], "field__hypernym__state": ["collapsed"], "field__hypernym__source": ["\"Toward a Theory of property Rights\", The American Economic Review 57 , p. 347."], "field__hypernym__author": ["Harold Demsetz"], "field__auto": [1], "field__d": ["y"], "field__wikt": ["color"], "training": ["Academy_of_Fine_Arts,_Munich"], "training__homepage": [""], "training__lat": [48.15305709838867], "training__long": [11.58027744293213], "training__subject": ["Category:1808_establishments_in_Bavaria", "Category:Coop_Himmelblau", "Category:Deconstructivism", "Category:Culture_in_Munich", "Category:Buildings_and_structures_completed_in_2005", "Category:Renaissance_Revival_architecture_in_Germany", "Category:Tourist_attractions_in_Munich", "Category:Universities_and_colleges_in_Munich", "Category:Historicist_architecture_in_Munich", "Category:Educational_institutions_established_in_1808", "Category:Maxvorstadt", "Category:Academy_of_Fine_Arts,_Munich", "Category:School_buildings_completed_in_1886"], "training__subject__broader": ["Category:1808_establishments_in_Germany", "Category:1808_establishments_in_Europe", "Category:Architecture_of_Austria", "Category:20th-century_architectural_styles", "Category:Architectural_styles", "Category:Architectural_history", "Category:Postmodern_architecture", "Category:21st-century_architectural_styles", "Category:Munich", "Category:Culture_by_city_in_Germany", "Category:Culture_of_Altbayern", "Category:German_architecture_by_period", "Category:Renaissance_architecture_in_Germany", "Category:Renaissance_Revival_architecture_by_country", "Category:Tourist_attractions_in_Bavaria", "Category:Tourist_attractions_in_Germany_by_city", "Category:Tourism_in_Munich", "Category:Buildings_and_structures_in_Munich", "Category:Education_in_Munich", "Category:Universities_and_colleges_in_Germany_by_city", "Category:Tourist_attractions_in_Munich", "Category:Universities_and_colleges_in_Bavaria", "Category:Historicist_architecture_in_Germany", "Category:Boroughs_of_Munich", "Category:Universities_and_colleges_in_Munich", "Category:Art_schools_in_Germany", "Category:Wikipedia_categories_named_after_universities_and_colleges_in_Germany"], "training__point": ["48.153055555555554 11.580277777777777"], "training__closeMatch": ["grid.466255.6"], "training__geometry": [null]}
