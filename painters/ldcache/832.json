He has now come forward in a new character\u2014as a painter in the great style of epic composition; and if his future efforts do but equal the expectations raised by his first essay, we shall have reasons to rejoice at the change. His ideal group of \"The Combat\", in the present exhibition at the Royal Academy, is particularly striking, from its uncommon combination of beauties, without possessing any very extraordinary merit in any single quality, taken separately. Its style of colouring, perhaps, forms its most distinguishing feature; and in this respect the artist has still adhered closely to the system pursued by the Venetian school. The arrangement of his colours is admirably successful, and we could instance individual passages of extraordinary beauty. Of these, none is more eminently deserving than the right foot of the female, which seems actually to glow with the rich juice of life. Generally speaking, the extremities are well understood, and carefully executed, and the composition of the figures is in the most masterly style.", "The effect of this picture would have been much more intense had the painter treated it as a mere fact, and had not brought upon the scene those flying Cupids who turn the thing into a mythological fable. Real boys dressed like Cupids would have been proper, but aerial beings are impertinences, and put one out when one is thinking of the sex. If this amorous pageant had been a mere fiction, instead of having actually taken place, still the power of its delineation would have consisted in its probability.", "Therefore when she was sent unto by divers letters, both from Antonius himself and also from his friends, she made so light of it and mocked Antonius so much that she disdained to set forward otherwise but to take her barge in the river of Cydnus, the poop whereof was of gold, the sails of purple, and the oars of silver, which kept stroke in rowing after the sound of the music of flutes, howboys, cithernes, viols, and such other instruments as they played upon in the barge. And now for the person of herself: she was laid under a pavilion of cloth of gold of tissue, apparelled and attired like the goddess Venus commonly drawn in picture; and hard by her, on either hand of her, pretty fair boys apparelled as painters do set forth god Cupid, with little fans in their hands, with the which they fanned wind upon her. Her ladies and gentlewomen also, the fairest of them were apparelled like the nymphs Nereides  and like the Graces, some steering the helm, others tending the tackle and ropes of the barge, out of which there came a wonderful passing sweet savour of perfumes, that perfumed the wharf's side, pestered with innumerable multitudes of people."], "notableWork__headerAlign": ["center"], "notableWork__captionAlign": ["center"], "notableWork__alt": ["Semi-nude man prepares to stab a naked man, while a semi-nude woman clutches his waist", "near-nude woman on a horse, surrounded by people", "near-nude woman on a horse", "Naked people on a boat, naked people in the water around the boat, and a flying naked child blowing on the sails of the boat", "Gold boat full of naked people"], "notableWork__sign": [null, "Plutarch, Life of Anthony, translated by Sir Thomas North", "Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, March 1822"], "notableWork__direction": ["vertical", "horizontal"], "notableWork__hypernym__broader": ["Names,%20Organizational"], "notableWork__height": [525, 1118, 900, 1536], "notableWork__totalWidth": [320, 400], "notableWork__footerAlign": ["left"], "notableWork__footer": ["By the time of Musidora, Godiva was replacing Musidora as a pretext for English artists to paint nudes.", "Etty's Youth on the Prow pictures were condemned by some newspapers for their supposed indecency.
