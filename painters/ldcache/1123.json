And yet the one is so much a consequence of the other. For example, you knew the old Van de Sande Bakhuyzen and Jules Bakhuyzen. I thought of their work only recently, that with all the apparent difference there's still so little change in people's ideas. Anyway I believe that Jules Bakhuyzen, say, would understand perfectly what I paint these days, that ravine with the stream, and another painting \u2014 of the park at the asylum \u2014 large pine trees against an evening sky.\""], "author": ["Vincent van Gogh"]}
