this perfection compare the inhospitable actions of the civilized and especially of the commercial states of our part of the world. The injustice which they show to lands and peoples they visit  is carried by them to terrifying lengths. America, the lands inhabited by the Negro, the Spice Islands, the Cape, etc., were at the time of their discovery considered by these civilized intruders as lands without owners, for they counted the inhabitants as nothing. In East India , under the pretense of establishing economic undertakings, they brought in foreign soldiers and used them to oppress the natives, excited widespread wars among the various states, spread famine, rebellion, perfidy, and the whole litany of evils which afflict mankind.", "Kant's position on the importance of skin color not only as encoding but as proof of this codification of rational superiority or inferiority is evident in a comment he made on the subject of the reasoning capacity of a \"black\" person. When he evaluated a statement made by an African, Kant dismissed the statement with the comment: \"this fellow was quite black from head to foot, a clear proof that what he said was stupid.\" It cannot, therefore, be argued that skin color for Kant was merely a physical characteristic. It is, rather, evidence of an unchanging and unchangeable moral quality.", "\"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains. Those who think themselves the masters of others are indeed greater slaves than they.\"", "For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception. When my perceptions are removed for any time, as by sound sleep; so long I am insensible of myself, and may truly be said not to exist.", "Worldly worry always seeks to lead a human being into the small-minded unrest of comparisons, away from the lofty calmness of simple thoughts. To be clothed, then, means to be a human being-and therefore to be well clothed. Worldly worry is preoccupied with clothes and dissimilarity of clothes.  Should not the invitation to learn from the lilies be welcome to everyone just as the reminder is useful to him! Alas, those great, uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts, are more and more forgotten, perhaps entirely forgotten in the weekday and worldly life of comparisons. The one human being compares himself with others, the one generation compares itself with the other, and thus the heaped up pile of comparisons overwhelms a person. As the ingenuity and busyness increase, there come to be more and more in each generation who slavishly work a whole lifetime far down in the low underground regions of comparisons. Indeed, just as miners never see the light of day, so these unhappy people never come to see the light: those uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts about how glorious it is to be a human being. And up there in the higher regions of comparison, smiling vanity plays its false game and deceives the happy ones so that they receive no impression from those lofty, simple thoughts, those first thoughts.", "The most ancient parts of truth \u2026 also once were plastic. They also were called true for human reasons. They also mediated between still earlier truths and what in those days were novel observations. Purely objective truth, truth in whose establishment the function of giving human satisfaction in marrying previous parts of experience with newer parts played no role whatsoever, is nowhere to be found. The reasons why we call things true is the reason why they are true, for 'to be true' means only to perform this marriage-function."], "influencedBy__influencedBy__restingPlace": ["Panth\u00e9on, Paris, France", "Panth\u00e9on", "Paris", "Rouen_Monumental_Cemetery", "Montparnasse Cemetery, Paris"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__url": ["", "voltaire", "14509369%3Ftitle=Voltaire%3a%20Historian", "1804_The-Works-of-Plato-His-Fifty-Five-Dialogues-and-Twelve-Epistles_vols-1-5.pdf", "default.aspx%3Fpartid=73&pid=26413", "Kantian-ethics-and-economics.php", "ksp1", "9780199273676.do", "2184944", "perez.pdf", "intro.html", "14760", "42574", "49760", "books%3Fid=2KNFBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover", "13704", "31030", "33894", "books%3Fid=QImd2ARqQPMC&pg=PA66", "books%3Fid=H1H1CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0%23v=onepage&q&f=false", "worldfr.htm", "books%3Fid=TXopSMll0tEC&printsec=frontcover", "books%3Fid=fZvuT6Q76GAC&printsec=frontcover", "books%3Fid=Ca9aBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover", "berkeley.htm", "review.cfm%3Fid=13243", "review.cfm%3Fid=11464", "!syllabus.html", "berkbib.php", "BS_019_Daniel_New_Interp_Review.pdf", "156385", "social-theory", "Bergson_1911_toc.html", "Bergson_1910_toc.html", "adeus.html"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__almaMater": ["Coll\u00e8ge_Louis-le-Grand", "Magdalen_College,_Oxford", "University_of_Jena", "Martin_Luther_University_of_Halle-Wittenberg", "University_of_Edinburgh", "University of Paris", "\u00c9cole_Normale_Sup\u00e9rieure", "University_of_Paris", "Humboldt_University_of_Berlin", "University_of_Heidelberg", "University_of_Amsterdam", "Harvard University"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__occupation": ["Writer, philosopher", "Natural_philosophy", "Playwright", "Poet", "Diplomat", "Novelist", "Civil_servant", "Novelist, pamphleteer, physician", "Psychoanalyst", "Psychologist", "Wilhelm_Stekel__PersonFunction__1", "Critic", "Essayist", "Marcel_Proust__PersonFunction__1", "", "essayist", "critic", "social theorist", "activist", "writer", "Philosopher", "journalist", "Writer"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__wstitle": ["Voltaire, Fran\u00e7ois Marie Arouet de"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__partner": ["Marie_Louise_Mignot", "\u00c9milie_du_Ch\u00e2telet", "Th\u00e9r\u00e8se_Levasseur", "Elisabeth_Blochmann", "Hannah Arendt", "Jean-Paul_Sartre", "", "Claude Lanzmann", "Nelson Algren"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__first": ["George"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__last": ["Saintsbury"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__date": [2012, 2009, 2010, 2021, 2017, 2013, 2006, 2011, 2014, 2016, 2020, 2018, "February 2019"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__nationality": ["French", "British_people", "English", "Austria", "Austrian", "Statelessness", "Prussian", "", "Stateless", "Dutch_people"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__birthName": ["Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet", "John Locke", "Bento de Espinosa", "David Home", "Johann Wolfgang Goethe", "S\u00f8ren Aabye Kierkegaard", "Louis Ferdinand Auguste Destouches", "Karl Heinrich Marx", "Henri-Louis Bergson", "Edmund Gustav Albrecht Husserl", "Emmanuelis Levinas", "Valentin Louis Georges Eug\u00e8ne Marcel Proust", "Maurice Jean Jacques Merleau-Ponty", "Simone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir", "Aleksandr Vladimirovich Kozhevnikov", "Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer", "George Edward Moore"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__sign": ["Voltaire"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__pages": [199], "influencedBy__influencedBy__volume": [28], "influencedBy__influencedBy__authorLink": ["George Saintsbury"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__id": ["Gibbon,+Edward", "Locke,+John+", "Kant,+Immanuel", "Spinoza,+Benedictus+de", "Descartes,+Ren\u00e9", "Hume,+David", "Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von", "Goethe,+Johann+Wolfgang+von", "Hegel,+Georg+Wilhelm+Friedrich", "lfceline", "Marx,+Karl", "Flaubert,+Gustave", "flaubert", "Bergson,+Henri", "Proust, Marcel", "Proust,+Marcel", "beauvoir"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__office": ["Member of Parliament for Lymington", "Member of Parliament for Liskeard"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__termPeriod": ["Edward_Gibbon__Tenure__1", "Edward_Gibbon__Tenure__2"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__party": ["Whigs_(British_political_party)"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__years": [1774, 1781], "influencedBy__influencedBy__successor": ["William_Manning_(British_politician)", "Samuel_Salt", "Harry Burrard", "Wilbraham Tollemache", "James_Stopford_(bishop)"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__predecessor": ["Thomas_Dummer", "Sir_Harry_Burrard,_1st_Baronet,_of_Lymington", "Edward_Craggs-Eliot,_1st_Baron_Eliot", "Samuel_Salt", "Edward_Synge_(bishop_of_Elphin)"], "influencedBy__influencedBy__term": [1774, 1781, 1734], "influencedBy__influencedBy__quote": ["In a distant age and climate the tragic scene of the death of Hosein will awaken the sympathy of the coldest reader.", "But you Communists would introduce community of women, screams the whole bourgeoisie in chorus.\nThe bourgeois sees in his wife a mere instrument of production.

perfection compare the inhospitable actions of the civilized and especially of the commercial states of our part of the world. The injustice which they show to lands and peoples they visit  is carried by them to terrifying lengths. America, the lands inhabited by the Negro, the Spice Islands, the Cape, etc., were at the time of their discovery considered by these civilized intruders as lands without owners, for they counted the inhabitants as nothing. In East India , under the pretense of establishing economic undertakings, they brought in foreign soldiers and used them to oppress the natives, excited widespread wars among the various states, spread famine, rebellion, perfidy, and the whole litany of evils which afflict mankind.", "Kant's position on the importance of skin color not only as encoding but as proof of this codification of rational superiority or inferiority is evident in a comment he made on the subject of the reasoning capacity of a \"black\" person. When he evaluated a statement made by an African, Kant dismissed the statement with the comment: \"this fellow was quite black from head to foot, a clear proof that what he said was stupid.\" It cannot, therefore, be argued that skin color for Kant was merely a physical characteristic. It is, rather, evidence of an unchanging and unchangeable moral quality.", "\"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains. Those who think themselves the masters of others are indeed greater slaves than they.\"", "For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception. When my perceptions are removed for any time, as by sound sleep; so long I am insensible of myself, and may truly be said not to exist.", "Worldly worry always seeks to lead a human being into the small-minded unrest of comparisons, away from the lofty calmness of simple thoughts. To be clothed, then, means to be a human being-and therefore to be well clothed. Worldly worry is preoccupied with clothes and dissimilarity of clothes.  Should not the invitation to learn from the lilies be welcome to everyone just as the reminder is useful to him! Alas, those great, uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts, are more and more forgotten, perhaps entirely forgotten in the weekday and worldly life of comparisons. The one human being compares himself with others, the one generation compares itself with the other, and thus the heaped up pile of comparisons overwhelms a person. As the ingenuity and busyness increase, there come to be more and more in each generation who slavishly work a whole lifetime far down in the low underground regions of comparisons. Indeed, just as miners never see the light of day, so these unhappy people never come to see the light: those uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts about how glorious it is to be a human being. And up there in the higher regions of comparison, smiling vanity plays its false game and deceives the happy ones so that they receive no impression from those lofty, simple thoughts, those first thoughts.", "The most ancient parts of truth \u2026 also once were plastic. They also were called true for human reasons. They also mediated between still earlier truths and what in those days were novel observations. Purely objective truth, truth in whose establishment the function of giving human satisfaction in marrying previous parts of experience with newer parts played no role whatsoever, is nowhere to be found. The reasons why we call things true is the reason why they are true, for 'to be true' means only to perform this marriage-function."], "influencedBy__influences__restingPlace": ["Panth\u00e9on, Paris, France", "Panth\u00e9on", "Paris", "Rouen_Monumental_Cemetery", "Montparnasse Cemetery, Paris"], "influencedBy__influences__url": ["", "voltaire", "14509369%3Ftitle=Voltaire%3a%20Historian", "1804_The-Works-of-Plato-His-Fifty-Five-Dialogues-and-Twelve-Epistles_vols-1-5.pdf", "default.aspx%3Fpartid=73&pid=26413", "Kantian-ethics-and-economics.php", "ksp1", "9780199273676.do", "2184944", "perez.pdf", "intro.html", "14760", "42574", "49760", "books%3Fid=2KNFBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover", "13704", "31030", "33894", "books%3Fid=QImd2ARqQPMC&pg=PA66", "books%3Fid=H1H1CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0%23v=onepage&q&f=false", "worldfr.htm", "books%3Fid=TXopSMll0tEC&printsec=frontcover", "books%3Fid=fZvuT6Q76GAC&printsec=frontcover", "books%3Fid=Ca9aBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover", "berkeley.htm", "review.cfm%3Fid=13243", "review.cfm%3Fid=11464", "!syllabus.html", "berkbib.php", "BS_019_Daniel_New_Interp_Review.pdf", "156385", "social-theory", "Bergson_1911_toc.html", "Bergson_1910_toc.html", "adeus.html"], "influencedBy__influences__almaMater": ["Coll\u00e8ge_Louis-le-Grand", "Magdalen_College,_Oxford", "University_of_Jena", "Martin_Luther_University_of_Halle-Wittenberg", "University_of_Edinburgh", "University of Paris", "\u00c9cole_Normale_Sup\u00e9rieure", "University_of_Paris", "Humboldt_University_of_Berlin", "University_of_Heidelberg", "University_of_Amsterdam", "Harvard University"], "influencedBy__influences__occupation": ["Writer, philosopher", "Natural_philosophy", "Playwright", "Poet", "Diplomat", "Novelist", "Civil_servant", "Novelist, pamphleteer, physician", "Psychoanalyst", "Psychologist", "Wilhelm_Stekel__PersonFunction__1", "Critic", "Essayist", "Marcel_Proust__PersonFunction__1", "", "essayist", "critic", "social theorist", "activist", "writer", "Philosopher", "journalist", "Writer"], "influencedBy__influences__wstitle": ["Voltaire, Fran\u00e7ois Marie Arouet de"], "influencedBy__influences__partner": ["Marie_Louise_Mignot", "\u00c9milie_du_Ch\u00e2telet", "Th\u00e9r\u00e8se_Levasseur", "Elisabeth_Blochmann", "Hannah Arendt", "Jean-Paul_Sartre", "", "Claude Lanzmann", "Nelson Algren"], "influencedBy__influences__first": ["George"], "influencedBy__influences__last": ["Saintsbury"], "influencedBy__influences__date": [2012, 2009, 2010, 2021, 2017, 2013, 2006, 2011, 2014, 2016, 2020, 2018, "February 2019"], "influencedBy__influences__nationality": ["French", "British_people", "English", "Austria", "Austrian", "Statelessness", "Prussian", "", "Stateless", "Dutch_people"], "influencedBy__influences__birthName": ["Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet", "John Locke", "Bento de Espinosa", "David Home", "Johann Wolfgang Goethe", "S\u00f8ren Aabye Kierkegaard", "Louis Ferdinand Auguste Destouches", "Karl Heinrich Marx", "Henri-Louis Bergson", "Edmund Gustav Albrecht Husserl", "Emmanuelis Levinas", "Valentin Louis Georges Eug\u00e8ne Marcel Proust", "Maurice Jean Jacques Merleau-Ponty", "Simone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir", "Aleksandr Vladimirovich Kozhevnikov", "Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer", "George Edward Moore"], "influencedBy__influences__sign": ["Voltaire"], "influencedBy__influences__pages": [199], "influencedBy__influences__volume": [28], "influencedBy__influences__authorLink": ["George Saintsbury"], "influencedBy__influences__id": ["Gibbon,+Edward", "Locke,+John+", "Kant,+Immanuel", "Spinoza,+Benedictus+de", "Descartes,+Ren\u00e9", "Hume,+David", "Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von", "Goethe,+Johann+Wolfgang+von", "Hegel,+Georg+Wilhelm+Friedrich", "lfceline", "Marx,+Karl", "Flaubert,+Gustave", "flaubert", "Bergson,+Henri", "Proust, Marcel", "Proust,+Marcel", "beauvoir"], "influencedBy__influences__office": ["Member of Parliament for Lymington", "Member of Parliament for Liskeard"], "influencedBy__influences__termPeriod": ["Edward_Gibbon__Tenure__1", "Edward_Gibbon__Tenure__2"], "influencedBy__influences__party": ["Whigs_(British_political_party)"], "influencedBy__influences__years": [1774, 1781], "influencedBy__influences__successor": ["William_Manning_(British_politician)", "Samuel_Salt", "Harry Burrard", "Wilbraham Tollemache", "James_Stopford_(bishop)"], "influencedBy__influences__predecessor": ["Thomas_Dummer", "Sir_Harry_Burrard,_1st_Baronet,_of_Lymington", "Edward_Craggs-Eliot,_1st_Baron_Eliot", "Samuel_Salt", "Edward_Synge_(bishop_of_Elphin)"], "influencedBy__influences__term": [1774, 1781, 1734], "influencedBy__influences__quote": ["In a distant age and climate the tragic scene of the death of Hosein will awaken the sympathy of the coldest reader.", "But you Communists would introduce community of women, screams the whole bourgeoisie in chorus.\nThe bourgeois sees in his wife a mere instrument of production.

perfection compare the inhospitable actions of the civilized and especially of the commercial states of our part of the world. The injustice which they show to lands and peoples they visit  is carried by them to terrifying lengths. America, the lands inhabited by the Negro, the Spice Islands, the Cape, etc., were at the time of their discovery considered by these civilized intruders as lands without owners, for they counted the inhabitants as nothing. In East India , under the pretense of establishing economic undertakings, they brought in foreign soldiers and used them to oppress the natives, excited widespread wars among the various states, spread famine, rebellion, perfidy, and the whole litany of evils which afflict mankind.", "Kant's position on the importance of skin color not only as encoding but as proof of this codification of rational superiority or inferiority is evident in a comment he made on the subject of the reasoning capacity of a \"black\" person. When he evaluated a statement made by an African, Kant dismissed the statement with the comment: \"this fellow was quite black from head to foot, a clear proof that what he said was stupid.\" It cannot, therefore, be argued that skin color for Kant was merely a physical characteristic. It is, rather, evidence of an unchanging and unchangeable moral quality.", "\"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.

When my perceptions are removed for any time, as by sound sleep; so long I am insensible of myself, and may truly be said not to exist.", "Worldly worry always seeks to lead a human being into the small-minded unrest of comparisons, away from the lofty calmness of simple thoughts. To be clothed, then, means to be a human being-and therefore to be well clothed. Worldly worry is preoccupied with clothes and dissimilarity of clothes.  Should not the invitation to learn from the lilies be welcome to everyone just as the reminder is useful to him! Alas, those great, uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts, are more and more forgotten, perhaps entirely forgotten in the weekday and worldly life of comparisons. The one human being compares himself with others, the one generation compares itself with the other, and thus the heaped up pile of comparisons overwhelms a person. As the ingenuity and busyness increase, there come to be more and more in each generation who slavishly work a whole lifetime far down in the low underground regions of comparisons. Indeed, just as miners never see the light of day, so these unhappy people never come to see the light: those uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts about how glorious it is to be a human being. And up there in the higher regions of comparison, smiling vanity plays its false game and deceives the happy ones so that they receive no impression from those lofty, simple thoughts, those first thoughts.", "The most ancient parts of truth \u2026 also once were plastic. They also were called true for human reasons. They also mediated between still earlier truths and what in those days were novel observations. Purely objective truth, truth in whose establishment the function of giving human satisfaction in marrying previous parts of experience with newer parts played no role whatsoever, is nowhere to be found. The reasons why we call things true is the reason why they are true, for 'to be true' means only to perform this marriage-function."], "influences__influencedBy__restingPlace": ["Panth\u00e9on, Paris, France", "Panth\u00e9on", "Paris", "Rouen_Monumental_Cemetery", "Montparnasse Cemetery, Paris"], "influences__influencedBy__url": ["", "voltaire", "14509369%3Ftitle=Voltaire%3a%20Historian", "1804_The-Works-of-Plato-His-Fifty-Five-Dialogues-and-Twelve-Epistles_vols-1-5.pdf", "default.aspx%3Fpartid=73&pid=26413", "Kantian-ethics-and-economics.php", "ksp1", "9780199273676.do", "2184944", "perez.pdf", "intro.html", "14760", "42574", "49760", "books%3Fid=2KNFBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover", "13704", "31030", "33894", "books%3Fid=QImd2ARqQPMC&pg=PA66", "books%3Fid=H1H1CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0%23v=onepage&q&f=false", "worldfr.htm", "books%3Fid=TXopSMll0tEC&printsec=frontcover", "books%3Fid=fZvuT6Q76GAC&printsec=frontcover", "books%3Fid=Ca9aBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover", "berkeley.htm", "review.cfm%3Fid=13243", "review.cfm%3Fid=11464", "!syllabus.html", "berkbib.php", "BS_019_Daniel_New_Interp_Review.pdf", "156385", "social-theory", "Bergson_1911_toc.html", "Bergson_1910_toc.html", "adeus.html"], "influences__influencedBy__almaMater": ["Coll\u00e8ge_Louis-le-Grand", "Magdalen_College,_Oxford", "University_of_Jena", "Martin_Luther_University_of_Halle-Wittenberg", "University_of_Edinburgh", "University of Paris", "\u00c9cole_Normale_Sup\u00e9rieure", "University_of_Paris", "Humboldt_University_of_Berlin", "University_of_Heidelberg", "University_of_Amsterdam", "Harvard University"], "influences__influencedBy__occupation": ["Writer, philosopher", "Natural_philosophy", "Playwright", "Poet", "Diplomat", "Novelist", "Civil_servant", "Novelist, pamphleteer, physician", "Psychoanalyst", "Psychologist", "Wilhelm_Stekel__PersonFunction__1", "Critic", "Essayist", "Marcel_Proust__PersonFunction__1", "", "essayist", "critic", "social theorist", "activist", "writer", "Philosopher", "journalist", "Writer"], "influences__influencedBy__wstitle": ["Voltaire, Fran\u00e7ois Marie Arouet de"], "influences__influencedBy__partner": ["Marie_Louise_Mignot", "\u00c9milie_du_Ch\u00e2telet", "Th\u00e9r\u00e8se_Levasseur", "Elisabeth_Blochmann", "Hannah Arendt", "Jean-Paul_Sartre", "", "Claude Lanzmann", "Nelson Algren"], "influences__influencedBy__first": ["George"], "influences__influencedBy__last": ["Saintsbury"], "influences__influencedBy__date": [2012, 2009, 2010, 2021, 2017, 2013, 2006, 2011, 2014, 2016, 2020, 2018, "February 2019"], "influences__influencedBy__nationality": ["French", "British_people", "English", "Austria", "Austrian", "Statelessness", "Prussian", "", "Stateless", "Dutch_people"], "influences__influencedBy__birthName": ["Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet", "John Locke", "Bento de Espinosa", "David Home", "Johann Wolfgang Goethe", "S\u00f8ren Aabye Kierkegaard", "Louis Ferdinand Auguste Destouches", "Karl Heinrich Marx", "Henri-Louis Bergson", "Edmund Gustav Albrecht Husserl", "Emmanuelis Levinas", "Valentin Louis Georges Eug\u00e8ne Marcel Proust", "Maurice Jean Jacques Merleau-Ponty", "Simone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir", "Aleksandr Vladimirovich Kozhevnikov", "Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer", "George Edward Moore"], "influences__influencedBy__sign": ["Voltaire"], "influences__influencedBy__pages": [199], "influences__influencedBy__volume": [28], "influences__influencedBy__authorLink": ["George Saintsbury"], "influences__influencedBy__id": ["Gibbon,+Edward", "Locke,+John+", "Kant,+Immanuel", "Spinoza,+Benedictus+de", "Descartes,+Ren\u00e9", "Hume,+David", "Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von", "Goethe,+Johann+Wolfgang+von", "Hegel,+Georg+Wilhelm+Friedrich", "lfceline", "Marx,+Karl", "Flaubert,+Gustave", "flaubert", "Bergson,+Henri", "Proust, Marcel", "Proust,+Marcel", "beauvoir"], "influences__influencedBy__office": ["Member of Parliament for Lymington", "Member of Parliament for Liskeard"], "influences__influencedBy__termPeriod": ["Edward_Gibbon__Tenure__1", "Edward_Gibbon__Tenure__2"], "influences__influencedBy__party": ["Whigs_(British_political_party)"], "influences__influencedBy__years": [1774, 1781], "influences__influencedBy__successor": ["William_Manning_(British_politician)", "Samuel_Salt", "Harry Burrard", "Wilbraham Tollemache", "James_Stopford_(bishop)"], "influences__influencedBy__predecessor": ["Thomas_Dummer", "Sir_Harry_Burrard,_1st_Baronet,_of_Lymington", "Edward_Craggs-Eliot,_1st_Baron_Eliot", "Samuel_Salt", "Edward_Synge_(bishop_of_Elphin)"], "influences__influencedBy__term": [1774, 1781, 1734], "influences__influencedBy__quote": ["In a distant age and climate the tragic scene of the death of Hosein will awaken the sympathy of the coldest reader.", "But you Communists would introduce community of women, screams the whole bourgeoisie in chorus.\nThe bourgeois sees in his wife a mere instrument of production.

compare the inhospitable actions of the civilized and especially of the commercial states of our part of the world. The injustice which they show to lands and peoples they visit  is carried by them to terrifying lengths. America, the lands inhabited by the Negro, the Spice Islands, the Cape, etc., were at the time of their discovery considered by these civilized intruders as lands without owners, for they counted the inhabitants as nothing. In East India , under the pretense of establishing economic undertakings, they brought in foreign soldiers and used them to oppress the natives, excited widespread wars among the various states, spread famine, rebellion, perfidy, and the whole litany of evils which afflict mankind.", "Kant's position on the importance of skin color not only as encoding but as proof of this codification of rational superiority or inferiority is evident in a comment he made on the subject of the reasoning capacity of a \"black\" person. When he evaluated a statement made by an African, Kant dismissed the statement with the comment: \"this fellow was quite black from head to foot, a clear proof that what he said was stupid.\" It cannot, therefore, be argued that skin color for Kant was merely a physical characteristic. It is, rather, evidence of an unchanging and unchangeable moral quality.", "\"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.

To be clothed, then, means to be a human being-and therefore to be well clothed. Worldly worry is preoccupied with clothes and dissimilarity of clothes.  Should not the invitation to learn from the lilies be welcome to everyone just as the reminder is useful to him! Alas, those great, uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts, are more and more forgotten, perhaps entirely forgotten in the weekday and worldly life of comparisons. The one human being compares himself with others, the one generation compares itself with the other, and thus the heaped up pile of comparisons overwhelms a person. As the ingenuity and busyness increase, there come to be more and more in each generation who slavishly work a whole lifetime far down in the low underground regions of comparisons. Indeed, just as miners never see the light of day, so these unhappy people never come to see the light: those uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts about how glorious it is to be a human being. And up there in the higher regions of comparison, smiling vanity plays its false game and deceives the happy ones so that they receive no impression from those lofty, simple thoughts, those first thoughts.", "The most ancient parts of truth \u2026 also once were plastic. They also were called true for human reasons. They also mediated between still earlier truths and what in those days were novel observations. Purely objective truth, truth in whose establishment the function of giving human satisfaction in marrying previous parts of experience with newer parts played no role whatsoever, is nowhere to be found. The reasons why we call things true is the reason why they are true, for 'to be true' means only to perform this marriage-function."], "influences__influences__restingPlace": ["Panth\u00e9on, Paris, France", "Panth\u00e9on", "Paris", "Rouen_Monumental_Cemetery", "Montparnasse Cemetery, Paris"], "influences__influences__url": ["", "voltaire", "14509369%3Ftitle=Voltaire%3a%20Historian", "1804_The-Works-of-Plato-His-Fifty-Five-Dialogues-and-Twelve-Epistles_vols-1-5.pdf", "default.aspx%3Fpartid=73&pid=26413", "Kantian-ethics-and-economics.php", "ksp1", "9780199273676.do", "2184944", "perez.pdf", "intro.html", "14760", "42574", "49760", "books%3Fid=2KNFBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover", "13704", "31030", "33894", "books%3Fid=QImd2ARqQPMC&pg=PA66", "books%3Fid=H1H1CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0%23v=onepage&q&f=false", "worldfr.htm", "books%3Fid=TXopSMll0tEC&printsec=frontcover", "books%3Fid=fZvuT6Q76GAC&printsec=frontcover", "books%3Fid=Ca9aBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover", "berkeley.htm", "review.cfm%3Fid=13243", "review.cfm%3Fid=11464", "!syllabus.html", "berkbib.php", "BS_019_Daniel_New_Interp_Review.pdf", "156385", "social-theory", "Bergson_1911_toc.html", "Bergson_1910_toc.html", "adeus.html"], "influences__influences__almaMater": ["Coll\u00e8ge_Louis-le-Grand", "Magdalen_College,_Oxford", "University_of_Jena", "Martin_Luther_University_of_Halle-Wittenberg", "University_of_Edinburgh", "University of Paris", "\u00c9cole_Normale_Sup\u00e9rieure", "University_of_Paris", "Humboldt_University_of_Berlin", "University_of_Heidelberg", "University_of_Amsterdam", "Harvard University"], "influences__influences__occupation": ["Writer, philosopher", "Natural_philosophy", "Playwright", "Poet", "Diplomat", "Novelist", "Civil_servant", "Novelist, pamphleteer, physician", "Psychoanalyst", "Psychologist", "Wilhelm_Stekel__PersonFunction__1", "Critic", "Essayist", "Marcel_Proust__PersonFunction__1", "", "essayist", "critic", "social theorist", "activist", "writer", "Philosopher", "journalist", "Writer"], "influences__influences__wstitle": ["Voltaire, Fran\u00e7ois Marie Arouet de"], "influences__influences__partner": ["Marie_Louise_Mignot", "\u00c9milie_du_Ch\u00e2telet", "Th\u00e9r\u00e8se_Levasseur", "Elisabeth_Blochmann", "Hannah Arendt", "Jean-Paul_Sartre", "", "Claude Lanzmann", "Nelson Algren"], "influences__influences__first": ["George"], "influences__influences__last": ["Saintsbury"], "influences__influences__date": [2012, 2009, 2010, 2021, 2017, 2013, 2006, 2011, 2014, 2016, 2020, 2018, "February 2019"], "influences__influences__nationality": ["French", "British_people", "English", "Austria", "Austrian", "Statelessness", "Prussian", "", "Stateless", "Dutch_people"], "influences__influences__birthName": ["Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet", "John Locke", "Bento de Espinosa", "David Home", "Johann Wolfgang Goethe", "S\u00f8ren Aabye Kierkegaard", "Louis Ferdinand Auguste Destouches", "Karl Heinrich Marx", "Henri-Louis Bergson", "Edmund Gustav Albrecht Husserl", "Emmanuelis Levinas", "Valentin Louis Georges Eug\u00e8ne Marcel Proust", "Maurice Jean Jacques Merleau-Ponty", "Simone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir", "Aleksandr Vladimirovich Kozhevnikov", "Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer", "George Edward Moore"], "influences__influences__sign": ["Voltaire"], "influences__influences__pages": [199], "influences__influences__volume": [28], "influences__influences__authorLink": ["George Saintsbury"], "influences__influences__id": ["Gibbon,+Edward", "Locke,+John+", "Kant,+Immanuel", "Spinoza,+Benedictus+de", "Descartes,+Ren\u00e9", "Hume,+David", "Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von", "Goethe,+Johann+Wolfgang+von", "Hegel,+Georg+Wilhelm+Friedrich", "lfceline", "Marx,+Karl", "Flaubert,+Gustave", "flaubert", "Bergson,+Henri", "Proust, Marcel", "Proust,+Marcel", "beauvoir"], "influences__influences__office": ["Member of Parliament for Lymington", "Member of Parliament for Liskeard"], "influences__influences__termPeriod": ["Edward_Gibbon__Tenure__1", "Edward_Gibbon__Tenure__2"], "influences__influences__party": ["Whigs_(British_political_party)"], "influences__influences__years": [1774, 1781], "influences__influences__successor": ["William_Manning_(British_politician)", "Samuel_Salt", "Harry Burrard", "Wilbraham Tollemache", "James_Stopford_(bishop)"], "influences__influences__predecessor": ["Thomas_Dummer", "Sir_Harry_Burrard,_1st_Baronet,_of_Lymington", "Edward_Craggs-Eliot,_1st_Baron_Eliot", "Samuel_Salt", "Edward_Synge_(bishop_of_Elphin)"], "influences__influences__term": [1774, 1781, 1734], "influences__influences__quote": ["In a distant age and climate the tragic scene of the death of Hosein will awaken the sympathy of the coldest reader.", "But you Communists would introduce community of women, screams the whole bourgeoisie in chorus.\nThe bourgeois sees in his wife a mere instrument of production.
