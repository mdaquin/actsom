dripping wet canvas covered the entire floor ... There was complete silence ... Pollock looked at the painting. Then, unexpectedly, he picked up can and paint brush and started to move around the canvas. It was as if he suddenly realized the painting was not finished. His movements, slow at first, gradually became faster and more dance like as he flung black, white, and rust colored paint onto the canvas. He completely forgot that Lee and I were there; he did not seem to hear the click of the camera shutter ... My photography session lasted as long as he kept painting, perhaps half an hour. In all that time, Pollock did not stop. How could one keep up this level of activity? Finally, he said \"This is it.\"\n\nPollock's finest paintings ... reveal that his all-over line does not give rise to positive or negative areas: we are not made to feel that one part of the canvas demands to be read as figure, whether abstract or representational, against another part of the canvas read as ground. There is not inside or outside to Pollock's line or the space through which it moves. ... Pollock has managed to free line not only from its function of representing objects in the world, but also from its task of describing or bounding shapes or figures, whether abstract or representational, on the surface of the canvas.", "My painting does not come from the easel. I prefer to tack the unstretched canvas to the hard wall or the floor. I need the resistance of a hard surface. On the floor I am more at ease. I feel nearer, more part of the painting, since this way I can walk around it, work from the four sides and literally be  the painting.\n\nI continue to get further away from the usual painter's tools such as easel, palette, brushes, etc. I prefer sticks, trowels, knives and dripping fluid paint or a heavy impasto with sand, broken glass or other foreign matter added.\n\nWhen I am  my painting, I'm not aware of what I'm doing. It is only after a sort of \"get acquainted\" period that I see what I have been about. I have no fear of making changes, destroying the image, etc., because the painting has a life of its own. I try to let it come through. It is only when I lose contact with the painting that the result is a mess. Otherwise there is pure harmony, an easy give and take, and the painting comes out well."], "movement__majorfigures__source": ["My Painting, 1947", "Karmel, 132"], "movement__majorfigures__notableWork": ["Mural_on_Indian_Red_Ground", "Convergence_(Pollock)", "Blue_Poles", "The_Deep_(painting)", "Autumn_Rhythm_(Number_30)", "No._5,_1948", "Number_17A"], "movement__majorfigures__author": ["Jackson Pollock"], "movement__majorfigures__multiline": ["true"], "movement__majorfigures__reason": ["The cited source  is in a psychiatric journal, which implies that in fact this is not, strictly speaking, \"historians\", but psychiatrists writing history."], "movement__majorfigures__bot": ["InternetArchiveBot"], "movement__majorfigures__fixAttempted": ["yes"], "movement__majorfigures__broader": ["Still,%20Clyfford,%20Museum"], "movement__majorfigures__restingPlace": ["Pipe Creek Church of the Brethren Cemetery, Union Bridge, Maryland", "Union_Bridge,_Maryland"], "movement__majorfigures__awards": ["Edward MacDowell Medal", "National Medal of Arts", "Presidential Medal of Freedom", "Praemium Imperiale"], "movement__majorfigures__works": ["Woman I, Easter Monday, Attic, Excavation"], "movement__majorfigures__award": ["Praemium_Imperiale", "National_Medal_of_Arts", "List_of_Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom_recipients", "Edward_MacDowell_Medal"], "movement__yearsactive": ["Late 1940s\u2013present"], "movement__hypernym__wordnet_type": ["synset-phonograph_record-noun-1"], "movement__wikiPageRedirects": ["Color_field"], "movement__wikiPageRedirects__subject": ["Category:Art_movements", "Category:Modern_art", "Category:Abstract_expressionism", "Category:Western_art", "Category:American_contemporary_art", "Category:Abstract_art", "Category:American_art_movements"], "movement__wikiPageRedirects__caption": ["Ronnie Landfield, Rite of Spring, 1985.
