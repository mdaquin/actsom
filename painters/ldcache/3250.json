If you're like, 'Wow, this is really fucking cool tonight, man,' they're all gonna sit there going, 'What a wanker. He's leaving. How can it be cool?'

Write the first note, and don't know what the second one's going to be. About halfway through you suddenly realise what it is you're writing about.\"", "\"I guess it was the first time I really thought about leaving.
